    "QuickBooks help small business owners manage their financials. One capabilities that Quickbooks offers is that it connects with customers’ bank account, and have their business accounts’ transactions populated into QuickBooks, so that customers can keep track of their expenses and revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers can manually tag the expense lines to a specific category, in order to have a better understanding and manage their expenses. But it will be a great advantage that QuickBooks can reasonably accurately categorize the expense types automatically for customers, so that customers can use their valuable time on something more exciting. Machine learning can come into play in this case, to categorize the expenses based on the attributes of the transactions. \n",
